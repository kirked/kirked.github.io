    Recommended a new architecture based on Scala &amp; Akka in order to fully utilise the throughput capabilities of existing host environments.
   </p>
   <p>
    Created a pilot product to replace and enhance the existing customer statement production. One customer’s statement processing required 16 hours per night to complete using the existing PL/SQL code. Using the new Java/Akka-based code, that was reduced to 18 minutes.
   </p>

    The created pilot product was suitable for multi-hosting, and completely configuration-driven, making it easy to maintain and update for multiple customers.

   <p>
    Principal member of what became a very large team (~160 developers) charged with creating a system to interface to the terminal-based mainframe for reservation bookings.
   </p>
   <p>
    Initiated a project, and created a compiler, to generate Java source code from formatted comments in CORBA interface specifications, resulting in several key benefits:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      Developers do not need to understand CORBA programming; only interface definition.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      40% of the overall product is code-generated by this compiler, resulting in less required testing and future maintenance.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Interface changes are as simple as changing the definition file.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Developers are able to concentrate on business logic.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Desired changes in interfacing code can be made at one place in the compiler and applied to the entire codebase with ease.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Designed core APIs for several of the 38 services in this system.
   </p>
   <p>
    Designed and wrote the primary orchestrating service used by client applications to manage customer reservations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Created a browser plugin (GreaseMonkey) to boost productivity of service support personnel by 200%.
   </p>
   <p>
    Created a script to correlate a single customer transaction across the 38 services’ (fault-tolerant) log files, resulting in a savings of 4 hours of work per problem report research, a 5000% productivity increase.
